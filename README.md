This project is an online hymn book designed to make it easy to search for and access hymns in multiple languages. The website includes an index of songs with a live search feature, allowing users to search for hymns by title or transliteration. Songs are displayed in an ordered list, sorted alphabetically by title on initial page load.

Features

Multilingual Hymns: Hymns are listed in various languages, with each title displaying its transliteration and/or English translation.
Alphabetically Sorted List: Hymns are initially sorted in ascending alphabetical order for easy navigation.
Live Search: A search bar allows users to find hymns quickly. As the user types, the list dynamically filters to show matching results based on transliterated text.
Responsive Design: The website is designed to be accessible and user-friendly across devices.
